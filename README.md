![Navigation Bar Mobile](assets/docs/features/navigation-bar-mobile.png)
- On smaller screens, the menu is displayed below the logo. In order to reduce the necessary steps to navigate to a different page, the full menu is also shown on small devices instead of the usual hamburger menu. 

![Navigation Bar Small](assets/docs/features/navigation-bar-small.png)
- To accommodate extra small screens (~280px), the menu changes to a vertical list when there is not enough space for the horizontal list.

#### Contact Us

- The submit button is placed at the bottom of the form.

- All the inputs utilise the 'required' attribute to ensure that all the inputs are filled with valid data before submission.

- Since the form only requires easy information from the user, any hints or placeholders were omitted from the form. This achieves a clean and modern look.

## Design  

### Colours  
![Colour Palette](assets/docs/colour-palette.png)
- The website uses a palette of three grayscale tones,  dark blue as the primary colour and orange as the accent colour.
- The greyscale colours are used as the main text and background colour.
- The primary colour is used for all the headings and interactable elements on the page. It is also used as the background colour for the footer to clearly separate it from the content.
- The accent colour is used for contrast and it pairs well with the rest of the palette.

### Typography  
- For the page logo and headings, the font Oswald was used.
- For the menu and body, the font Poppins was used.
- The page uses a font size of 20px for greater readability and accessability for older audience.

## Testing

- I have tested the mobile version with Safari on an ios device.
- I have shared the website with multiple users to confirm the website functionality on different devices and to get feedback on their experience.

### Bugs  
#### Fixed Bugs  
- Hero video didn't show the first frame as a placeholder until the video was completely loaded. Fixed by placing a poster attribute.
- The Hero video only played in fullscreen on ios devices. Fixed by adding a 'playsinline' attribute.
- After compressing the hero video with a modern compression method, the video stopped playing on multiple devices. Fixed by reverting back to a more widely supported compression method.
#### Unfixed bugs  
There are no unfixed bugs.

## Deployment

### Development process

- I started the program and repository by using the [gitpod template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) provided by the Code Insitute.  
- Then I regularly staged my changes using the command `git add <filename>` and then committed the staged changes to my local repository using `git commit -m 'short descriptive message here'`. 
- Finally, I would push the commits from my local repository up to the Github repository using the command `git push`.
- With every push, Github automatically deploys my latest commit from the 'main' branch to the Github pages.
